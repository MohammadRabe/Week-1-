Entity Relationships diagram

- rectangle for entity        

- oval shape for attribute


-----------Entities-------------
it's the objects

types :

- strong --------------> whose existence does not depend on the parent entity existence
- weak ----------------> whos existence depends ***the key in weak called partial key***

example of weak entity : if we have two entities one is for employee and two for his car the car entity is weak


-----------Attributes-----------

- simple 
- composite : an attribute breaks down into more attributes ( the attr consists of them )
- multi-valued : an attr have more than one column ----> it's represented by two ellipses
- complex : multi-valued and composite in the same time
- derieved : derieved from other attributes


-----------Relationships--------

properties : - degree of relationship
	     - cardinality
	     - participation

* degree of relashionship (type of relationship) : - unary (recursive)
					           - binary (common)
						   - ternary

* cardinality ( the max of type ) : 

_ one-to-one
_ one-to-many
_ many-to-many

* participation ( the min of type ): 

- total participation ========> all instances of this type should do this relation
- partial participation ======> not nesserily for the type to do this relation


-----------Keys-----------------

types : 
* super keys : all possible keys
	- candidate key : the minimal super-key
	- composite key : composite
* primary key : the chosen key
* alternate key : the not chosen candidate keys
* natural key : a key has meaning in reality
* surrogate key : a key that doesn't
* foriegn key : a key that refers to a key in another table to take the validation from its column
