
____Relational DB____

* structured
* tables
* objects in form of tuples (rows)
* mostly it has a primary key (a unique attribute)
* SQL is the standard language
* the schema (data model) is exciplict to changing


examples of relational DB systems : Oracle, postger,  SQLserver, mySQL
_______________________________________________

____NoSQL DB____

* semi-structured
* flexible schema ( easily adaptable to changes )
* no specific language

-- types on NoSQL DB : 

- graph DB
objects is about nodes and each two nodes have a relation there is an edge has the data of the relation
examples : tigerGraph, cosmosDB

- key-value hash
array has key-value pairs
* suitable when there are frequent queries
example : RocDB

- wide-column stores
* suitable for analytical queries ( when we need to use a specific attribute from objects or merge two cols )
example : Google BigTable

- document DB
objects is about documents 
group of docs is a collection

examples: JSON, XML  files
examples of docDB : MongoDB, couchbase

Relational and NoSQL differ to each other also due to : scaling , transaction

____Scaling____

there are two types of scaling : vertical, horizontal

- vertical scaling is to upgrade the server resources 
- horizontal scaling is to make the database distributed on multiple machines or virtual machines and that's sharding/partitioning which divides database into one of two types : vertical shards ( some of columns ) or horizontal shards ( some of tuples )

____Transaction____

like transfer a sum form a client to another

* A system is called transactional system if it has ACID properties
Atomicty: all operations done or nothing 
Consistency: the constrains are applied on the data
Isolation: the transaction is performed as if it's the only one
Durability: the data be saved after the transaction is done

* Relational DB is transactional  --  not all No-SQL support transaction
