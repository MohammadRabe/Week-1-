Normalization database is to reduce redundency and improve integrity
there are five layers must be taken one by another to get a safe database

___________(1NF)first normal form____________

to detect that :

- there is no multi-valued members in a column
- no use of the row order to convey info in order
- there is a primary key ( to prevent duplication ) 

*prevented by DBMS by default
- a column doesn't have different datatypes
- not more than one column have the same name ( same attribute name have two values )


___________(2NF)second normal form____________

- DB satisfies 1NF
- detect that all non-primary-key attributes depend on primary key

2NF sovles : deletion anomaly, update anomaly, insertion anomaly


___________(3NF)third normal form_____________

- DB satisfies 2NF 
- detect that no non-key depends on non-key

3Nf solves : the same of 2NF


___________(3.5NF)BCNF=Boyc-codd-normal-form__ 

- 3NF satisfied
- no key depends on non-key ( seldom happens )

___________4NF_____________

- 3.5NF satisfied
- every non-trivial multi-valued dependencies must depend on the key
( if we have many things related to many things we'd better to separate them )

___________5NF_____________

- 4NF satisfied
- there is no join-dependencies ----------> joined tables
the action is to separate them into the joined tables
